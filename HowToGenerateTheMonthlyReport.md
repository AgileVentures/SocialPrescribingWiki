If you swich to rejected and mouse over any of the times you can see the dates of the most recent rejections:

If the dates of any are in the current month (of the report) then they can be included in the number of rejected contributions. The `[No longer a spammer]` shows that the rejection was a spam submission.  Check with the moderator (Sam Joseph) for any where the reason for rejection is unclear.
