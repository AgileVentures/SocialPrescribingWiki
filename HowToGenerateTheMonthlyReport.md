1. **List the number of rejected contributions with reasons**

Visit https://wiki.healthylondon.org and visit https://wiki.healthylondon.org/Special:Moderation (Note this requires mode)

Since we've added the ConfirmEdit captcha on signups you'll likely see the following:

If you swich to rejected and mouse over any of the times you can see the dates of the most recent rejections:

If the dates of any are in the current month (of the report) then they can be included in the number of rejected contributions. The `[No longer a spammer]` shows that the rejection was a spam submission.  Check with the moderator ([Sam Joseph](https://github.com/tansaku)) for any where the reason for rejection is unclear.

Examples:

> 0 rejected submissions.

OR

> 154 rejected submissions of which all were "spam" (irrelevant) submissions.

2. **Capacity required for moderation and time spent**

In order to describe the time spent on moderation there's no alternative at the moment to checking with the moderator ([Sam Joseph](https://github.com/tansaku) - we need to look at some way of automating this - perhaps some improvements to the moderation tool so that each approved edit gets logged with a reason ...

Examples:

> 0 This month we added the ConfirmEdit plugin and set it to display a "captcha" on the create account page, preventing non-human automated signups.  As a result there were no spam signups or submissions this month.   This has allowed admin time to be refocused on other improvements and ensuring the effective operation of the moderation of new human users. This month have spent less than an hour moderating incoming submissions and reviewing updates from auto-moderated members

OR

> In this second month the 154 "spam" submissions were again all very clearly irrelevant to the site, i.e. submissions on topics completely unrelated to healthcare. The moderation was largely handled by the automated system. Admins spent at most a couple of hours reviewing submissions, rejecting "spam" submissions and marking spammers as such. The authors of sensible submissions were quickly marked as moderator approved (requiring no more than a couple of hours over the month), and as such there were no on-topic submissions that needed to be rejected, and few that required moderation approval.

3. **Any issues with the process and practice of moderation?**

Again there's no immediate alternative at the moment apart from checking with the moderator ([Sam Joseph](https://github.com/tansaku).  Perhaps some general logging tool might be useful here.

Examples: 

> As the number of spam submissions increased we added the ConfirmEdit plugin and set it to display a “captcha” on the create account page.  That went live around June 21st, and so far has completely eliminated spam submissions.  Existing users have been able to continue to submit as normal and several new users have signed up, implying that the plugin is working as expected (it was of course thoroughly tested before deployment, but there is nothing like the real world as an acid test).  This plugin has saved a good hour or two a month as the admins no longer have to review the 100 or 200 or so spam submissions for the possibility that there is a single sensible submission among them.  Admin time can thus be refocused on other improvements and ensuring the effective operation of the moderation of new human users.

OR

> It appears that the new "captcha" has completely eliminated spam submissions to the site. As a consequence some other issues have been amplified. No notification appeared for one suggested change by a new user; only a notification when a new user was created.  The new user submission has been approved, but it is unclear how long the user had to wait for approval. For next month AgileVentures will check that moderation notifications are in place accordingly, to ensure speedy approval of relevant submissions.
